  # NOTE

  Each .bsp file has lower quality (8bit) textures 'baked-in' the .bsp file itself.
  If you don't have the higher quality (24 bit) texture files installed, you will see the lower quality textures.

  Romero Base - Story - ;}
  Some Quakers in the quakeworld took an abandoned base and used it to play '4on4' team deathmatch matches.
  The base was already used in the past to play these matches, a guy named Romero placed items in it so clans could combat each other.
  These items are still there, the areas in the base are now coloured-styled related to those items. Looks nicer and helps new players navigating.
  The outside pent area also got a paint job and some structural things that make no sense but look weird, I mean artistical sophisticated.
  You now even want to spend time there while it's not pent time. To swim, for example, or just jump around.
